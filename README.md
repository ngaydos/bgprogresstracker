As a part of maintaing my not insignificant board game collection I have set a challenge to play every game in my collection over the course of 2018. As board games are not exclusively a one person hobby it is important to share this information with the group of people invested in the challenge. This project determines the current rate of progress by checking how much of the year has passes, compares it to the amount of completed board games in a SQL database and sends a message to a group chat via GroupMe providing a status update.
